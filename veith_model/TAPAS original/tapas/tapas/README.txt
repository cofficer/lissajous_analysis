DESCRIPTION
-----------

TAPAS is a collection of algorithms and software tools that are 
developed by the Translational Neuromodeling Unit (TNU) at Zurich. 
These tools have been developed to support translational neuroscience, 
particularly concerning the application of neuroimaging and 
computational modeling to research questions in psychiatry and 
neurology. Problems that can be addressed by tools in TAPAS presently include:

    - Correction of physiological noise in fMRI data.
    - Bayesian inference on computational processes from observed behaviour.
    - Bayesian mixed-effects inference for classification studies.
    - Variational-Bayes Linear Regression.

TAPAS is written in MATLAB and distributed as open source code under 
the GNU General Public License (GPL, Version 3).

------------

TAPAS is a collection of toolboxes written in MATLAB (Version R2012b). The key 
requirement is the installation of MATLAB (produced by The MathWorks, Inc.  
Natick, MA, USA. http://www.mathworks.com/).

To add the TAPAS directory to the MATLAB path, run the script tapas_init.m in the directory
where tapas is installed/extracted.
